# Few Things before we start

1.  Every session will start with a quick discussion on what will be build and
    we move to break out rooms.

2.  Please all of you chime in to proceed with the steps

3.  We have a packed agenda so I would ask that you type your questions in the
    chat so the presenter can follow up or address during planned Q&A

4.  We have planned breaks but if you need to step out for a few minutes no
    worries.

5. We are hoping you have completed prerequisites
