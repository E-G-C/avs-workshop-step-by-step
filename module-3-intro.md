### What you will learn

In this module, you will learn how to:

-   Install Site Recovery Manager in an AVS Private Cloud

-   Create a site pairing between two AVS Private Clouds in different Azure
    regions

-   Configure replications for AVS Virtual Machines

-   Configure SRM protection groups and recovery plans

-   Test and execute recovery plans

-   Re-protect recovered Virtual Machines and execute fail back

### Prerequisite knowledge

-   AVS Private Cloud administration (Azure Portal)

-   AVS network architecture, including connectivity across private clouds in
    different regions based on Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach

-   Familiarity with disaster recovery DR concepts such as RPO and RTO

-   Basic concepts of Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication, covered in
    the next two sections

### Module scenario

In this module, two AVS Private Clouds are used. VMWare Site Recovery Manager
will be configured at both sites to replicate VMs in the protected site to the
recovery site.

| Private Cloud Name | Location         | Role               |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| GROUP\#-AVS1-SDDC  | East US 2        | **Protected** Site |
| GROUP\#-AVS2-SDDC  | South Central US | **Recovery** Site  |

**The two private clouds have been already interconnected with each other in
Module 1, using ExpressRoute Global Reach. The diagram below depicts the
topology of the lab environment**.

### Site Recovery Manager

VMware Site Recovery Manager is a business continuity and disaster recovery
solution that helps you plan, test, and run the recovery of virtual machines
between a protected vCenter Server site and a recovery vCenter Server site. You
can use Site Recovery Manager to implement different types of recovery from the
protected site to the recovery site:

-   **Planned migration**: The orderly evacuation of virtual machines from the
    protected site to the recovery site. Planned migration prevents data loss
    when migrating workloads in an orderly fashion. For planned migration to
    succeed, both sites must be running and fully functioning.

-   **Disaster recovery**: Similar to planned migration except that disaster
    recovery does not require that both sites be up and running, for example if
    the protected site goes offline unexpectedly. During a disaster recovery
    operation, failure of operations on the protected site is reported but is
    otherwise ignored.

Site Recovery Manager **orchestrates the recovery process with VM replication
between the protected and the recovery site**, to minimize data loss and system
down time. At the protected site, Site Recovery Manager shuts down virtual
machines cleanly and synchronizes storage, if the protected site is still
running. Site Recovery Manager powers on the replicated virtual machines at the
recovery site according to a recovery plan. A recovery plan specifies the order
in which virtual machines start up on the recovery site. A recovery plan
specifies network parameters, such as IP addresses, and can contain
user-specified scripts that Site Recovery Manager can run to perform custom
recovery actions on virtual machines.

Site Recovery Manager lets you **test recovery plans**. You conduct tests by
using a temporary copy of the replicated data in a way that does not disrupt
ongoing operations at either site.

Site Recovery Manager supports both hybrid (protected site on-prem, recovery
site on AVS) and cloud-to-cloud scenarios (protected and recovery sites on AVS,
in different Azure regions). This lab covers the cloud-to-cloud scenario only.

Site Recovery Manager is installed by deploying the **Site Recovery Manager
Virtual Appliance** on an ESXi host in a vSphere environment. The Site Recovery
Manager Virtual Appliance is a preconfigured virtual machine that is optimized
for running Site Recovery Manager and its associated services. After you deploy
and configure Site Recovery Manager instances on both sites, the Site Recovery
Manager plug-in appears in the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere Client. The
figure below shows the high-level architecture for a SRM site pair.

### vSphere replication

SRM can work with multiple replication technologies: Array-based replication,
vSphere (aka host-based) replication, vVols replication and a combination of
array-based and vSphere replication ([learn
more](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Site-Recovery-Manager/8.3/com.vmware.srm.admin.doc/GUID-35BBE965-ADC3-4E6E-A094-3D0037DA8528.html)).
AVS Private Clouds run on hyperconverged physical infrastructure powered by
VMwareâ€™s first-party storage virtualization software, vSAN. As such, **the only
replication technology that can be used with SRM in AVS is vSphere replication,
which does not require storage arrays**. With vSphere replication, the storage
source and target can be any storage device. vSphere Replication is configured
on a per-VM basis, allowing you to control which VMs are duplicated.

![](media/4390100ec5e84088fcdaad8dce762258.png)

vSphere Replication requires a virtual appliance to be deployed from an Open
Virtualization Format (OVF) file using the vSphere Web Client. The first virtual
appliance deployed at each site is referred to as the **vSphere Replication
management server**. It contains the necessary components to receive replicated
data, manage authentication, maintain mappings between the source virtual
machines and the replicas at the target location and provide support for Site
Recovery Manager. Additional vSphere Replication appliances can be deployed to
support larger-scale deployments and topologies with multiple target locations.
These additional virtual appliances are referred to as **vSphere Replication
servers**.

The components that transmit replicated data (the **vSphere Replication agent**
and a **vSCSI filter**) are built into vSphere. They provide the plug-in
interfaces for configuring and managing replication, track the changes to VMDKs,
automatically schedule replication to achieve the RPO for each protected virtual
machine, and transmit the changed data to one or more vSphere Replication
virtual appliances. There is no need to install or configure these components,
further simplifying vSphere Replication deployment.

When the target is a vCenter Server environment, data is transmitted from the
source vSphere host to either a vSphere Replication management server or vSphere
Replication server and is written to storage at the target location.

![](media/d95f6098d2f1f96765ebd76e5d24fab7.png)

vSphere Replication begins the initial full synchronization of the source
virtual machine to the target location, using TCP port 31031. A copy of the
VMDKs to be replicated can be created and shipped to the target location and
used as **seeds,** reducing the time and network throughput. Changes to the
protected virtual machine are tracked and replicated on a regular basis. The
transmissions of these changes are referred to as **lightweight delta syncs.**
Their frequency is determined by the RPO that was configured for the virtual
machine. A lower RPO requires more-frequent replication and network bandwidth
consumed by the initial full synchronization.

The replication stream can be encrypted. As data is being replicated, the
changes are first written to a file called a redo log, which is separate from
the base disk. After all changes for the current replication cycle have been
received and written to the redo log, the data in the redo log is consolidated
into the base disk. This process helps ensure the consistency of each base disk
so virtual machines can be recovered at any time, even if replication is in
progress or network connectivity is lost during transmission.

### Site Recovery Concepts

-   **Inventory Mappings.** For array-based protection and vSphere Replication
    protection, Site Recovery Manager applies inventory mappings to all virtual
    machines in a protection group when you create that group. Inventory
    mappings provide default objects in the inventory on the recovery site for
    the recovered virtual machines to use when you run recovery. Site Recovery
    Manager cannot protect a virtual machine unless it has valid inventory
    mappings. However, configuring site-wide inventory mappings is not mandatory
    for array-based replication protection groups and vSphere Replication
    protection groups. If you create vSphere Replication protection group
    without having defined site-wide inventory mappings, you can configure each
    virtual machine in the group individually. You can override site-wide
    inventory mappings by configuring the protection of the virtual machines in
    a protection group. You can also create site-wide inventory mappings after
    you create a protection group, and then apply those site-wide mappings to
    that protection group.

-   **Protection Groups**. A protection group is a collection of virtual
    machines that Site Recovery Manager protects together. After you create a
    vSphere Replication protection group, Site Recovery Manager creates
    placeholder virtual machines on the recovery site and applies the inventory
    mappings to each virtual machine in the group. If Site Recovery Manager
    cannot map a virtual machine to a folder, network, or resource pool on the
    recovery site, Site Recovery Manager sets the virtual machine to the Mapping
    Missing status, and does not create a placeholder for it

-   **Recovery Plan.** A recovery plan is like an automated run book. It
    controls every step of the recovery process, including the order in which
    Site Recovery Manager powers on and powers off virtual machines, the network
    addresses that recovered virtual machines use, and so on. Recovery plans are
    flexible and customizable. A recovery plan includes one or more protection
    groups. You can include a protection group in more than one recovery plan.
    For example, you can create one recovery plan to handle a planned migration
    of services from the protected site to the recovery site for the whole
    organization, and another set of plans per individual departments. **You can
    run only one recovery plan at a time to recover a particular protection
    group.**

-   **Reprotection.** After a recovery, the recovery site becomes the primary
    site, but the virtual machines are not protected yet. If the original
    protected site is operational, you can reverse the direction of protection
    to use the original protected site as a new recovery site to protect the new
    protected site. Manually re-establishing protection in the opposite
    direction by recreating all protection groups and recovery plans is time
    consuming and prone to errors. **Site Recovery Manager provides the
    reprotect function, which is an automated way to reverse protection.**
    Reprotect uses the protection information that you established before a
    recovery to reverse the direction of protection. You can initiate the
    reprotect process only after recovery finishes without any errors. You can
    conduct tests after a reprotect operation completes, to confirm that the new
    configuration of the protected and recovery sites is valid.
